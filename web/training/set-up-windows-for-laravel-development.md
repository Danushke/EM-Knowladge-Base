# Set-up Windows For Laravel Development

Laravel development environment needs to have **Apache**, **PHP**, **MySQL** and **Composer** installed mainly. Though all of these software can be installed on Windows, we prefer using Linux or Mac for the development of Laravel projects.

In case your only option is to use a computer running Windows, we recommend activating [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/wsl/install-win10#windows-10-fall-creators-update-and-later-install-from-the-microsoft-store).

Make sure you install Ubuntu 20.04 when you are installing your Linux distribution of choice at **Step 6** of above guide.

Once you are done. Please refer to [Set-up Linux For Laravel Development](set-up-linux-for-laravel-development.md) guide on how to set it up for Laravel development.
