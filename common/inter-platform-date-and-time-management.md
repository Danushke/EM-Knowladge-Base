# Inter Platform Date & Time Management

## Problem

There needs to be a standard way to handle cross timezone communication. In the past, we've been using the device or browser's time - but this causes problems if the user has set the device time incorrectly. All applications must use a standard timezone for all uses (eg. GMT), and convert and display as needed. A proper library/framework is needed for this.
